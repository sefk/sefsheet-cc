# Initial Prompt

I would like to create a simple spreadsheet called “SefSheet”. It
should be a web app in the style of Google Sheets.

The user can navigate around a grid of cells, selecting individual
cells, or rows, or columns, or the sheet. If a single cell is
selected, a value can be entered into that cell. The user should
be able to change the basic formatting of selected cells: color,
font, font size, font styling (bold, italics, underline).

Beyond these basic initial requirements, please ask me five questions
to further clarify the requirements. Then give me your implementation
plan for my approval before implementing the app.

# Constraints

Do not read or write any files outside the "SefSheet-CC" directory.

Do not push or pull anything to GitHub yourself.
